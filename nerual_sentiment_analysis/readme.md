Sentiement analysis is one of the hottest topics for the social media driven world.
There are applications of this in several sectors such as reviews, social media posts as well as check text messages/emails

In this project, the aim is to use simple neural networks to achieve this task. 
We aim to perform this task without using any external ml packages

Approach:
We use the bag of words approach with unigrams and bigrams to get a better idea of the context. 
Algorithms implemented :Perceptron and Multi Layered Perceptron

The implementation of the Nerual Networks was done from scratch without using Datascience packages such as sklearn,pytorch or tensor flow
